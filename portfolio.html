      <p>Hello! Iâ€™m an aspiring web developer passionate about learning!</p>
      <h2 class="projectheading">Figure Drawing</h2>
      <div class="portsection">
        <p class="pportfolio">
          This is a figure drawing I did a few months back. I was trying to
          re-familiarize myself with drawing proportions! I always loved figure
          drawing so this was a fun mini-project.

          So I actually hate painting because I am TERRIBLE at color theory. But
          I recently got a water color palette and I wanted to try out some
          muted colors! I am pretty happy with how this came out but I would
          love to keep practicing!

      <h2 class="projectheading">Painting!</h2>
      <div class="portsection">
        <p class="pportfolio">
          Again with the painting, I'm not a fan but practice makes perfect! I
          always find that if I'm struggling with a new skill, it helps to mix
          it with something you enjoy. So I love dogs and decided to make a
          silly painting of a dog reading a newspaper on the toilet. I struggled
          with mixing colors BUT I had fun anyway because it was a subject I
          liked!
