          Hello! This is my first ever website! I'm super excited to learn about
          software engineering and see how creative I can get. For my website I
          have decided to showcase some of my artwork because not only am I a
          student, but I am also an artist!! I think this is a great way to
          showcase some of my work and eventually build a portfolio for both my
          art and my coding! ENJOY!!!!
