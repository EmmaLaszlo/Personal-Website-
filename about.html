      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! Iâ€™m an aspiring web developer passionate about learning!</p>
      <h2 class="heading2">Hobbies</h2>
      <div class="abtsection">
        <p class="pabout">
          I think it's pretty clear that one of my hobbies is...ART!! I double
          majored in biology and studio art in college but my primary medium in
          art was drawing. I love charcoal and graphite drawing and I am always
          practicing my sketching! My main subjects are usually profiles or
          figure drawing, I love to combine art with my knowledge of biology!
          <br />
          I also really enjoy running, yoga, and hiking!

      <h2 class="heading2">Interests</h2>
      <div class="abtsection">
        <p class="pabout">
          I have A LOT of interests. I love anything biology related, the
          grosser the better! I have a really strong stomach so I don't get
          bothered by much! I particularly like horror movies and mystery books.
          I am currently reading "A Certain Hunger" and I want to see the new
          Nosferatu movie!

      <h2 class="heading2">Peeves</h2>
      <div class="abtsection">
        <p class="pabout">
          I thought it would be fun to include a little "pet peeves" section!
          Not that I have many things to be irritated by but I live in NYC and
          one of my BIGGEST pet peeves are slow walkers. It's true what they say
          about new yorkers, they always have somewhere to be!
